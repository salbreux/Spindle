# Spindle
There are 3 folders here:
## 1D
Simulates the 1D motion of a monopolar spindle; where the nucleus motion is obtained from the total force acting on it, and the LGN concentration changes according to a diffusion-reaction equation.
## 1D_for_fit
Compares the predicted concentration field to experimental measurements, with the nucleus motion imposed.
## 2D
Simulate the 2D rotation of a bipolar spindle in a elliptic cell. The shape of the cell is changing with time, the LGN concentration field on the contour of the cell changes according to a diffusion-reaction equation, and the spindle rotates according to the total torque acting on it.
