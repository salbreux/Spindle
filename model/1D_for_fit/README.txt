This code simulates the LGN concentration field dynamics with imposed nucleus motion that is obtained from experimental data, stored in Data_Monopolar. 

Monopolar.py contains a class and methods that are used for the simulation of the dynamics of the concentration field.

MonopolarFit.py is used to obtain the deviation in the LGN concentration field between simulation and experiments.

Run_Error_Calculation.py calculates the error function for the 12 quantified cells, for one set of parameters.
